=head1 Description

Table 276 â€” Entries in a requirement handler dictionary

=head1 Methods (Entries)

=head2 Type [name]
- (Optional) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes. If present, is ReqHandler for a requirement handler dictionary.

=head2 S [name]
- (Required) The type of requirement handler that this dictionary describes. Valid requirement handler types is JS (for ECMAScript requirement handlers) and NoOp.
A value of NoOp allows older PDF processors to ignore unrecognised requirements. This value does not add any specific entry to the requirement handler dictionary.

=head2 Script [text string]
- (Optional; valid only if the S entry has a value of JS) The name of a document-level ECMAScript action stored in the document name dictionary (see 7.7.4, "Name dictionary"). If the PDF processor understands the parent document requirements dictionary and can verify the requirement specified in that dictionary, it disables execution of the requirement handler identified in this dictionary.
