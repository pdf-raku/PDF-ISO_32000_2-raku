The row and column IDs is ordered from most specific to most general.\nIf the scope for any cells with an ID listed in the Headers attribute of a cell cannot be determined by the default algorithm defined in 14.8.4.8.3, \"Table structure types\", those header cells specifies a Scope so that the header can be determined to be either a row header, a column header or both.\nThis attribute may apply to header cells (TH) as well as data cells (TD). Therefore, the headers associated with any cell is those in its Headers array plus those in the Headers array of any TH cells in that array, and so on recursively."

It can become cumbersome for a user to repeatedly have to listen to the full contents of a TH structure element. An option to have the short form of the content of the TH structure element read out aloud is sometimes preferred."
