The transform parameter dictionary for this method indicates which additional permissions is granted for the document. If the signature is valid and recognized by the PDF processor, then the PDF processor shall allow the specified permissions for the document, in addition to the default permissions.\nNOTE For example, a PDF processor may not permit saving documents by default. The signature can be used to validate that the additional permissions placed within the PDF document have been granted by the authority or agent that did the signing."
