For a font program that is embedded in the PDF file, the default base encoding is the font program’s built-in encoding, as described in 9.6.5, \"Character encoding\" and further elaborated in the subclauses on specific font types. Otherwise, for a nonsymbolic font, it is StandardEncoding, and for a symbolic font, it is the font’s built-in encoding."
