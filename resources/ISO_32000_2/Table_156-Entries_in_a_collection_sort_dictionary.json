The array form is used to allow additional fields to contribute to the sort, where each additional field is used to break ties. More specifically, if multiple collection item dictionaries have the same value for the first field named in the array, the values for successive fields named in the array is used for sorting, until a unique order is determined or until the named fields are exhausted."

If the value is an array, each element of the array is a boolean value that specifies whether the entry at the same index in the S array is sorted in ascending or descending order.\nIf the number of entries in the A array is larger than the number of entries in the S array the extra entries in the A array is ignored. If the number of entries in the A array is less than the number of entries in the S array the missing entries in the A array is assumed to be true.\nDefault value: true."
