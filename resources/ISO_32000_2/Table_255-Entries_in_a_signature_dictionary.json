        "(Required; inheritable) The name of the preferred signature handler to use when validating this signature. If the Prop_Build entry is not present, it is also the name of the signature handler that was used to create the signature. If Prop_Build is present, it may be used to determine the name of the handler that created the signature (which is typically the same as Filter but is not needed to be). A PDF processor may substitute a different handler when verifying the signature, as long as it supports the specified SubFilter format. Example signature handlers are Adobe.PPKLite, Entrust.PPKEF, CICI.SignIt, and VeriSign.PPKVS. The name of the filter (i.e. signature handler) is identified in accordance with the rules defined in Annex E, \"Extending PDF\"."

Other values may be defined by developers, and when used, is prefixed with the registered developer identification. All prefix names is registered (see Annex E, \"Extending PDF\"). The prefix \"adbe\" and the prefix \"ETSI\" have been registered by Adobe Systems and ETSI, respectively, and the subfilter names listed above and defined in 12.8.3, \"Signature interoperability\" and 12.8.5, \"Document timestamp (DTS) dictionary\" may be used by any developer.\nThe values adbe.x509.rsa_sha1 and adbe.pkcs7.sha1 have been deprecated with PDF 2.0. To support backward compatibility, PDF readers should process these values for this key, but PDF writers does not use this value for this key."

The value of the messageImprint field within the TimeStampToken is a hash of the bytes of the document indicated by the ByteRange and the ByteRange specifies the complete PDF file contents (excepting the Contents value).\nSpace for the Contents value is allocated before the message digest is computed (see 7.3.4, \"String objects\")."
