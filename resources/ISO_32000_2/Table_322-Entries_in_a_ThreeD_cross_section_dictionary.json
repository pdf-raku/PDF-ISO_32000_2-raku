Exactly one of the values is null, indicating an initial state of the cutting plane that is perpendicular to the corresponding axis and clipping all geometry on the positive side of that axis. The other two values is numbers indicating the rotation of the plane, in degrees, around their corresponding axes. The order in which these rotations are applied matches the order in which the values appear in the array.\nDefault value: [null 0 0] specifying a cutting plane that is perpendicular to the X axis and coplanar with the Y and Z axes."

If true, an algorithm is applied with the result that additional temporary geometry may be created to represent a section cap. The section cap is visible within the area enclosed by the intersection of the 3D Node 3D geometry with the section plane. If the flag is false, no additional temporary geometry is created to represent a section cap. Default value: false."
