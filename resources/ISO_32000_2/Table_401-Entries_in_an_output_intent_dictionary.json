If human-readable, this string may be used in lieu of an OutputCondition string for presentation to the user.\nA typical value for this entry may be the name of a production condition maintained in an industry-standard registry such as the ICC Characterization Data Registry. If the designated condition matches that in effect at production time, the production software is responsible for providing the corresponding ICC profile as defined in the registry.\nIf the intended production condition is not a recognised standard, the value of this entry may be Custom or an application-specific, machine-readable name. The DestOutputProfile entry defines the ICC profile, and the Info entry is used for further human-readable identification."

The output transformation uses the profile’s \"from CIE\" information (BToA in ICC terminology); the \"to CIE\" (AToB) information may optionally be used to remap source colour values to some other destination colour space, such as for screen preview or hardcopy proofing."

This stream contains exactly one SpotInkCharacterisation element whose SpotInkName matches the colourant name (see 7.3.5, \"Name objects\"). In addition, this stream may contain zero or more further SpotInkCharacterisation elements, and/or other data.\nNOTE 3 This facilitates referencing the same CxF/X-4 data stream from more than one entry in the SpectralData dictionary, as long as for each such entry there is a matching SpotInkCharacterisation entry in the CxF/X-4 data stream.\nIn addition, each key in this dictionary does not also be present in the Solidities dictionary referenced from the MixingHints dictionary within the same output intent.\nNOTE 4 This is because it would not be clear which one is to be used, so by only allowing one place where such data are present it avoids the conflict.\nThis document intentionally does not specify how a PDF processor may make use of the data provided in the SpectralData dictionary, and a PDF processor may ignore such data altogether.\nEXAMPLE 2 The data in the SpectralData dictionary could be used in the process of rendering or colour converting the colourants specified in the SpectralData dictionary."
