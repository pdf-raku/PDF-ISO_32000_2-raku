        "(Sometimes required for Luminosity groups, otherwise optional) The group colour space, which is used for the following purposes:\nThe group colour space is any device or CIE-based colour space that treats its components as independent additive or subtractive values in the range 0.0 to 1.0, subject to the restrictions described in 11.3.4, \"Blending colour space\". These restrictions exclude Lab and lightness-chromaticity ICCBased colour spaces, as well as the special colour spaces Pattern, Indexed, Separation, and DeviceN. Device colour spaces is subject to remapping according to the DefaultGray, DefaultRGB, and DefaultCMYK entries in the ColorSpace subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see 8.6.5.6, \"Default colour spaces\").\nOrdinarily, the CS entry may be present only for isolated transparency groups (those for which I is true), and even then it is optional. However, this entry is present in the group attributes dictionary for any transparency group XObject that has no parent group or page from which to inherit — in particular, one that is the value of the G entry in a soft-mask dictionary of subtype Luminosity (see 11.6.5.1, \"Soft-mask dictionaries\").\nAdditionally, the CS entry may be present in the group attributes dictionary associated with a page object, even if I is false or absent. In the normal case in which the page is imposed directly on the output medium, the page group is effectively isolated regardless of the I value, and the specified CS value shall therefore be honoured.\nDefault value: the colour space of the parent group or page into which this transparency group is painted. (The parent’s colour space in turn may be either explicitly specified or inherited.)\nFor a transparency group XObject used as an annotation appearance (see 12.5.5, \"Appearance streams\"), the default colour space is inherited from the page on which the annotation appears."

If this flag is true, objects within the group is composited against a fully transparent initial backdrop; if false, they is composited against the group’s backdrop. Default value: false.\nIn the group attributes dictionary for a page, the interpretation of this entry is slightly altered. In the normal case in which the page is imposed directly on the output medium, the page group is effectively isolated and the specified I value is ignored."
