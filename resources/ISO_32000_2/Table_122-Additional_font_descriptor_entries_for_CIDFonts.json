If this entry is present, the CIDFont contains only a subset of the glyphs in the character collection defined by the CIDSystemInfo dictionary. If it is absent, the only indication of a CIDFont subset is the subset tag in the FontName entry (see 9.9.2, \"Font subsets\").\nThe stream’s data is organised as a table of bits indexed by CID. The bits is stored in bytes with the high-order bit first. Each bit corresponds to a CID. The most significant bit of the first byte corresponds to CID 0, the next bit to CID 1, and so on."
