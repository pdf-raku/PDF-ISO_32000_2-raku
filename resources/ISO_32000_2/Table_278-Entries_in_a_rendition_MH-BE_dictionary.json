        "(Optional) A media criteria dictionary (see \"Table 279 — Entries in a media criteria dictionary\").\nThe media criteria dictionary behaves somewhat differently than other MH/ BE entries described in 13.2.2, \"Viability\". The criteria specified by all of its entries is met regardless of whether it is in a MH or a BE dictionary. The only exception is that if an entry in a BE dictionary is unrecognised by the interactive PDF processor, it does not affect the viability of the object."
