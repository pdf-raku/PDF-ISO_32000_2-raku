The alternate space may be any valid colour space (except a Pattern colour space) that has the number of components specified by N. If this entry is omitted and the PDF reader does not understand the ICC profile data, the colour space that is used is DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, or DeviceCMYK, depending on whether the value of N is 1, 3, or 4, respectively. There is not conversion of source colour values, such as a tint transformation, when using the alternate colour space. Colour values within the range of the ICCBased colour space might not be within the range of the alternate colour space. In this case and after constraining to the ICCBased range, the nearest values within the range of the alternate space is substituted without error indication."
