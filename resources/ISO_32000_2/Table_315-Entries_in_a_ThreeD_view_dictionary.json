M is the only valid entry for 3D stream objects of type PRC (or it can be omitted).\nIf omitted, the view specified in the 3D artwork is used."

Each view node specifies a 3D transformation matrix (see 13.6.5, \"Coordinate systems for 3D\"); the concatenation of all the matrices forms the camera-to-world matrix.\nPDF writers specifies only a single text string, not an array, for this entry.\nNOTE 2 Do not confuse View Nodes with nodes. A View Node is a parameter in the 3D artwork that specifies a view; a node is a PDF dictionary that specifies 3D graphic objects or collections thereof."
