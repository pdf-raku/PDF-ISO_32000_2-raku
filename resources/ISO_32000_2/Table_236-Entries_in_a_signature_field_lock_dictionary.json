That is, permissions can be denied but not added. If the number specifies greater permissions than an MDP value already in effect, the new number is ignored.\nIf the document does not have an author signature, the initial permissions in effect are those based on the number 3.\nThe new permission applies to any incremental changes to the document following the signature of which this key is part."
