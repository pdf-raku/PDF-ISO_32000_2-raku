        "(Optional) A dictionary specifying the solidity of inks that is used in blending calculations when used as an alternative to the tint transformation function. For each entry, the key is a colourant name, and the value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0. This dictionary need not contain entries for all colourants used in this colour space; it may also include additional colourants not used by this colour space.\nA value of 1.0 simulates an ink that completely covers the inks beneath; a value of 0.0 simulates a transparent ink that completely reveals the inks beneath. An entry with a key of Default specifies a value that is used by all components in the associated DeviceN colour space for which a solidity value is not explicitly provided. If Default is not present, the default value for unspecified colourants is 0.0; interactive PDF processors may choose to use other values.\nIf this entry is present, PrintingOrder is also present."

        "(Required if Solidities is present) An array of colourant names, specifying the order in which inks is laid down. Each component in the names array of the DeviceN colour space appears in this array (although the order is unrelated to the order specified in the names array). This entry may also list colourants unused by this specific DeviceN instance.\nNOTE (2020) PrintingOrder precisely matches the optional ICC profile colorantOrderTag (ISO 15076-1, 9.2.17), which specifies physical colourant laydown relative to the substrate. It does not define viewing direction."

        "(Optional) A dictionary specifying the dot gain of inks that is used in blending calculations when used as an alternative to the tint transformation function. Dot gain (or loss) represents the amount by which a printer’s halftone dots change as the ink spreads and is absorbed by paper.\nFor each entry, the key is a colourant name, and the value is a function that maps values in the range 0 to 1 to values in the range 0 to 1. The dictionary may list colourants unused by this specific DeviceN instance and need not list all colourants. An entry with a key of Default specifies a function that is used by all colourants for which a dot gain function is not explicitly specified.\nPDF processors may ignore values in this dictionary when other sources of dot gain information are available, such as ICC profiles associated with the process colour space or tint transformation functions associated with individual colourants."
