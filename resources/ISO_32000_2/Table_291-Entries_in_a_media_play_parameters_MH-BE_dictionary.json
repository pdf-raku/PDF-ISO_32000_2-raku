A scrolling user interface is provided if the media rectangle is wider or taller than the play rectangle.\nNOTE 4 Same as \"scroll\" value of SMIL’s fit attribute.\n4 The media is not scaled. Only the portions of the media rectangle that intersect the play rectangle is displayed.\nNOTE 5 Same as \"hidden\" value of SMIL’s fit attribute.\n5 Use the player’s default setting (author has no preference).\nDefault value: 5.\nAn unrecognised value is treated as the default value if the entry is in a BE dictionary. If the entry is in an MH dictionary and it has an unrecognised value, the object is considered non-viable."
