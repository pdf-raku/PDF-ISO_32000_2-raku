The first element of each pair is a name and the second is a text string or text stream defining the script corresponding to that name. Each of the defined scripts is added to those already defined in the name dictionary and is then executed before the script defined in the Before entry is executed.\nNOTE As described in 12.6.4.17, \"ECMAScript actions\" these scripts are used to define ECMAScript functions for use by other scripts in the document."
