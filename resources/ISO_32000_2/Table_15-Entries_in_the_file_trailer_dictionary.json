Each PDF file identifier byte-string has a minimum length of 16 bytes. If there is an Encrypt entry, this array and the two byte-strings is direct objects and is unencrypted.\nNOTE 2 Because the ID entries are not encrypted, the ID key can be checked to assure that the correct PDF file is being accessed without decrypting the PDF file. The restrictions that the objects all be direct objects and not be encrypted ensure this.\nNOTE 3 Although this entry is optional prior to PDF 2.0, its absence can prevent the PDF file from functioning in some workflows that depend on PDF files being uniquely identified.\nNOTE 4 The values of the ID strings are used as input to the encryption algorithm. If these strings were indirect, or if the ID array were indirect, these strings would be encrypted when written. This would result in a circular condition for a PDF reader: the ID strings need be decrypted in order to use them to decrypt strings, including the ID strings themselves. The preceding restriction prevents this circular condition."
