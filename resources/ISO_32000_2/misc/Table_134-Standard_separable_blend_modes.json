When working with additive colours, multiplying any colour with black produces black while multiplying with white leaves the original colour unchanged. For subtractive colours, the maximum tint value used for all colourants of the colour space acts as black does for additive spaces. Painting successive overlapping objects with a colour other than black or white produces progressively darker colours."
