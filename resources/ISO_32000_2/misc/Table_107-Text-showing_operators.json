        "Show zero or more text strings, allowing individual glyph positioning. Each element of array is either a string or a number. If the element is a string, this operator shows the string. If it is a number, the operator adjusts the text position by that amount; that is, it translates the text matrix, Tm . The number is expressed in thousandths of a unit of text space (see 9.4.4, \"Text space details\"). This amount is subtracted from the current horizontal or vertical coordinate, depending on the writing mode. In the default coordinate system, a positive adjustment has the effect of moving the next glyph painted either to the left or down by the given amount. \"Figure 61 — Operation of the TJ operator in horizontal writing\" shows an example of the effect of passing offsets to TJ."
