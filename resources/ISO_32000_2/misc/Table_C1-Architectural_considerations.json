        "As described in this PDF standard, many constructs can be nested including stitching functions, q/Q operators, XObjects, article threads, etc. However PDF processors may implement recursive algorithms which may cause issues for excessively nested constructs.\nNOTE In previous versions of PDF, a maximum depth of graphics state nesting by q and Q operators was 28. This arose from the fact that q and Q can be implemented by the PostScript language gsave and grestore operators when generating PostScript language output."
